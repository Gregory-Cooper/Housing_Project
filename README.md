 Won 2022 Housing Affordability Case Challenge among 140+ AI &amp; DS interns : Used PCA and KMeans to build interpretable model of housing market

Project Description
Explored Zillow Data to approximate practical housing price index distributions using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering
Instead of simply splitting the data into income segments arbitrarily, we performed these steps so that the data would tell us the objective story
Graphed the principle components on latitude-longitude plots to confirm that the cluster data locations followed actual housing price density maps
Generated a pricing index similar to HPI for each cluster based on the relevant mortgage data
Decomposed this index by AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) stubs in order to verify that each mortgage data cluster actually represented a different homebuyer segment
Leveraged mortgage data to examine the distribution of AGI stubs in each cluster to verify that the population of homebuyers in each cluster represented different income segments
Performed multiple linear regression, random forest regression, and ridge regression to determine the most important features in predicting “HPI” within each income segment
Crafted data-driven policy recommendations based on the important features as determined by the above regression methods
Policy Summary: Increase Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) in order to raise GDP, lower the urban population, and boost tax revenue
